# ðŸ§Œ Kits

But letâ€™s be honest: a big part of the fun (50%, to be exact) comes from hunting down the perfect piece, at the right price, tailored to YOUR specific needs. This process is an essential part of the experience and challenge.\
If you decide to buy a pre-made kit, thatâ€™s your choice, and itâ€™s completely valid. However, be aware that the community might throw (figurative) rocks at you for taking a shortcut. Some believe that kits donâ€™t allow you to fully embrace the creative and learning journey that comes with building things from scratch.

#### Tips Before Buying a Voron Kit:

1. **Prioritize quality**: Cheaper kits may require replacements or adjustments, increasing long-term costs.
2. **Check compatibility**: Ensure the kit is compatible with the specific model you want to build (2.4, V0.2, Trident, etc.).
3. **Consider support**: Some suppliers (like LDO or Fabreeko) offer excellent customer service and technical support, especially helpful for beginners.
4. **Consult the Voron community**: Official forums and Discord servers are full of recommendations and user feedback on various kits.

That being said, not all kits are created equal. Hereâ€™s a (personal) tier list of the best kits available:
